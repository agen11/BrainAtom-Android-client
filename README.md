- Summary

** We create this general-purpose autonomous learning robot to help you master the information in a file(currently PDF format), or in a web page(next release). The mission of BrainAtom robot is to help you avoid spending days, months, years in studying the details of  specific domains or topics. By using it, you could have the knowledge of a scientist, engineer, doctor, teacher, lawyer in an unbelievable short period. Use it in any scenarios you like, like financing, making food, playing, planning travel, etc. Imagination is the only limitation. It works for you to absorb those information even when you are in sleep.

** Once your robot masters all the information on a topic, your individual search engine will be there to serve you and locate whatever you want to know based on the information mastered. Unlike traditional search engine, It is a personal search engine highly customized by you with objective prioritizing algorithm. Unlike traditional search engines we usually use, no special filtering applied to prevent you from reaching the information, you could have the search results in prioritized manner based on top-down and matching degree to your search keywords. As for the searching results, the especially useful feature is you do not have to read the long paragraphs to locate the information, all you have to do is to read a small piece of paragraphs that is most close to your interest. But the service does not stop there, you could easily tell if a found item is useful to you by checking the class node where it belongs and the matching degree to your search keyword. This could save you 80% of your precious time. The design and algorithm of natural language processing inside is dedicated to save your time in searching procedure and make you be an 'X-man'.

** The autonomous learning robot and the individual search engine will always be there and working in background to make you a hero.

** And all these services are just the beginning of the new era ...



- How to install

2. Authorize the app with all the permission needed(read/write permission).
3. Find a pdf file you want to master the information inside and upload it to your android phone, the file should be a normal pdf with 1 column per page.
4. After login into the app, in Autonomous Learner, select the file and create a node to store the outcome using auto-generating, then start the process. You could see the tip on maximum waiting time and the cost for current AI processing. You could do something else and wait for the results.
5. After the estimated time, if the AI succeeds, you could get an email notification. Make sure to check the spam folder for the email sender is not known to you email server.


What else could you do after learning?
Now you can search for any related information like what you do in the google, duckduckgo based on the learning results. All results are presented to you as some relatively smaller paragraphs. So you could locate the information quickly without reading lots of paragraphs. Since all the search results are prioritized to a matching degree, you could accelerate the search procedure more efficiently. There are some other functions to help you easily explore similar information in the same class.

The learning results could be viewed in a 3D data visualizer, which will help users to have rich knowledge about what has been learned and what could be searched using the search engine.

Of course, there are more services it could provide with the evolution of the app.
